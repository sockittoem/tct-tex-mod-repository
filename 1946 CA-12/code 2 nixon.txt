As the counting stretched into the thin hours of the morning, your hope wavered, then diminished, finally culminating in a shot of whiskey and a string of murmured curses as your defeat was certified.<p></p>Goddamn your lack of money, goddamn your inexperienced errors, goddamn the ungrateful bastards of the 12th district. You could almost swear this hurts more than just losing outright. They listened to you enough to make it close, to give you goddamned hope and make you look like an ass in front of all your colleagues, but not enough to actually put you where you should be. Why not? Why, even in these conditions, would the voters not reward you with what you worked for, goddamnit?</p>", "But it's not over yet, it's hardly even begun, and your career remains intact. You did get closer to unseating Voorhis than anyone else has, and hopes of another wave in '48 may give you the final bump you need to get by him. Two years to embed yourself in the community, two years to solve whatever party problems plagued you before, two years to win that next primary. Voorhis will have to take you seriously this time. You can bet that Ivy League bastard's never had a square fight in his life, but he'll have to watch you now. My God, he'll have to fear you.", "It isn't over yet.

Among higher circles, you're told, there are whispers of your name as a future prospect for Governor, maybe, or Senator. Perhaps even higher.", "But even this crushing success isn't enough. The doubters, the naysayers, the rat bastards who stood in your way – you may have won this round, but they remain, demeaning your victory and putting down your skill.

In the end, there's only one title you truly want now – not Senator, not Governor, but President of the United States.

Surely you also wish that you'd beaten Voorhis even harder than you did. But that's just petty grievances by now. As it stands, you will be the next House Representative from the California 12th, and that's what really matters.
