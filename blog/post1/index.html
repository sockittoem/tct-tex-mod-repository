		<p>Hey guys, to start off this blog I want to show you some work on my two big projects right now. McGovern 1984 and 1844 Redux (or Fear and Loathing 1844)</p>
        <p>Here's a show of something I'm adding to the Clay side of 1844 Redux, which as you may know, will be releasing after the Democratic sides.</p>

	   <p>Credit to Jet for coding this. I'm hoping this find of a kind choose-your-opponent screen will be a good counterpart to the large amount of work I'm putting</p>
        <p>into the Democratic side, to have all 4 sides playable. Likewise, unless the NCT team works on integrating this into their site, this may be a CTS exclusive.</p>
		<p>Second of all, I want to show you the McGovern 1984 starting map; which takes place before McGovern has actually been nominated.</p> 
		<img src="1984c1.png" style="height:300px;">
		<p>The issues and starting margins have all been finished, even including alternate primary winners in this timeline. As you can see, even before McGovern's nomination,</p>
		<p>the Democrats have an uphill battle.</p>
